// queries.ts — the single home for every SQL string (file-structure.md
// convention: no inline SQL elsewhere). Column names are quoted because the
// source schema uses spaces, dots and slashes (e.g. "Studbook No.", "CUR/N")
// and must match docs/schema-map.md [DOCUMENTED] exactly. Names are NOT assumed.
//
// All access is READ-ONLY (stack-decision.md): no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE exist
// in this file by design.
//
// SCHEMA VARIATION (confirmed 2026-06-25): source exports differ in how they
// name the genetics columns. The bundled sample uses the long names
// "Inbreeding Coefficient" / "Relationship Coefficient"; other exports (e.g. a
// real Japanese Spitz database) use the short names "COI" / "AVK".
// Selecting a column that does not exist makes SQLite reject the ENTIRE query,
// so the projection is built at connect time from the columns that are actually
// present (see buildSelectCols + database.ts). A field with no matching column
// degrades to NULL — never an error. See schema-map.md "Genetics columns".
//
// EXTENDED LAYOUT (2026-08-05): the projected field list is no longer written out
// here — it is derived from `SOURCE_FIELDS` in sourceFields.ts, the catalogue
// of the owner's agreed 74-column layout. Adding a column to the source database
// means adding one catalogue entry; this file does not change.
